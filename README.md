# Rookie Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level projects that I have worked on. Among them, some of my highest-quality and well-conceptual projects are linked below:

## [Jordan Chatbot (built with Kivy and KivyMD framework)](https://github.com/Abhishekvrt/JordanChatBot)
Jordan Chatbot is an automated conversational agent that simulates human-like conversations via text or text-to-speech. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface and automate customer interactions to enhance their experience.

## [ML-7 (our first website using web development)](https://github.com/Abhishekvrt/ml-7)
ML-7 is a website built using web development tools and technologies. It consists of a collection of web pages and related content that are hosted on a web server and identified by a common domain name. Notable examples of such websites include Wikipedia.

Feel free to explore and use these projects as a reference to build your own projects.
